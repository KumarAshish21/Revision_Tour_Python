# Singleton Design Pattern in Detail
# Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
# x = 'Hello'
# y = 'World'
# print(x + y)

# In a Python program, how would you open a file for both reading and writing without erasing the existing content?
# In Python, considering a List L1 = [4, 5, 6, 8, 9]. If we perform the operation L1.remove(4), what will be the result?

# L1 = [4, 5, 6, 8, 9]
# L1.remove(4)
# print(L1)

employee = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'title': 'Engineer'}
print(employee.get('age'))
