# Singly Vs Doubly Linked List (Advantages & Disadvantages)

 

# Advantages Of Doubly Linked List over Singly Linked List:

# In Singly Linked List, the traversal can be done using the next node link only. Thus traversal is possible in one direction only. Reversing the doubly linked list is very easy. In Doubly Linked List, the traversal can be done using the previous node link or the next node link. Thus traversal is possible in both directions (forward and backward).
# Complexity of deletion with a given node in Singly Linked List is O(n), because the previous node needs to be known, and traversal takes O(n). Whereas in Doubly Linked List, complexity of deletion with a given node is O(1) because the previous node can be accessed easily
# We can use a doubly linked list to execute heaps and stacks, binary trees.
# In case of better implementation, while searching, we prefer to use doubly linked list.
# Advantages of Singly Linked List over Doubly LL:

# The Singly Linked List occupies less memory than Doubly Linked List as it has only 2 fields. The Doubly Linked List occupies more memory as it has 3 fields.
# We mostly prefer to use singly linked list for the execution of stacks.
# A Singly Linked List consumes less memory as compared to the Doubly Linked List.
# When we do not need to perform any searching operation and we want to save memory, we prefer a singly linked list.
# Since elements in memory are stored randomly, therefore the elements are accessed sequentially no direct access is allowed.
