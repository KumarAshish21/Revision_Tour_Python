# Delete a node with pointer given to it
"""Given only a pointer to a node to be deleted in a singly linked list, how do you delete it?

A simple solution is to traverse the linked list until you find the node you want to delete. But this solution requires a pointer to the head node which contradicts the problem statement. 

The fast solution is to copy the data from the next node to the node to be deleted and delete the next node. Something like this:

It is important to note that this approach will only work if it is guaranteed that the given pointer does not point to the last node. Because if it is the last node, then you donâ€™t have a next node to copy the data from.

struct Node *temp  = node_ptr->next;
node_ptr->data  = temp->data;
node_ptr->next  = temp->next;
free(temp);
