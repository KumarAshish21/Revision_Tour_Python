# Middle of the Linked List
# Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.
#
# If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def middleNode(head):
    slow_ptr = head
    fast_ptr = head

    while fast_ptr and fast_ptr.next:
        slow_ptr = slow_ptr.next
        fast_ptr = fast_ptr.next.next

    return slow_ptr

# Example usage:
# Create a linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
head = ListNode(1)
head.next = ListNode(2)
head.next.next = ListNode(3)
head.next.next.next = ListNode(4)
head.next.next.next.next = ListNode(5)

middle = middleNode(head)
print(middle.val)  # Output: 3


# Linked List Cycle
# Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
#
# There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
#
# Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
# Output: true
# Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
# Output: true
# Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
